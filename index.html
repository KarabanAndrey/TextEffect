	<div class="block">A father came home from a long business trip to find his young son riding a brand new bike.</div>
	<div class="block">"Where did you get the money for that?" he asked.
	"It must have cost over 300 dollars!"</div>
	<div class="block">"I earned it hiking," replied the boy.</div>
	<div class="block">"Hiking??? Come on son; tell your Dad the truth. Nobody can make that sort of money hiking. Where did you Really get the cash from?"</div>
	<div class="block">"It's like I say, Dad. Every night when you were gone, Mr. Goldberg from the bank would come over to see Mom. He'd give me a 20 dollar bill and tell me to take a hike"!</div>
